I selected the News Category Dataset v3 because it helps to develop and evaluate a news article recommender system. It contains a rich set of authentic news articles that span various domains like politics, sports, entertainment, and technology. Such diversity allows the system to meaningfully differentiate topics and capture user preferences. The dataset contains headlines and full article descriptions which are both useful for my architecture. Headlines can be utilized for quick screening through LSH while the description enables deeper text semantic analysis through GPT embeddings and indexing using Faiss. Its organized format makes it easy to preprocess, generate embeddings, and evaluate with Scikit-learn.
